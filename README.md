# Playfest

Ever attend a music festival and wish you had sampled more of the artists' music?

Playfest is a web app that eliminates the inconvenience of manually creating a music festival specific Spotify playlist. Select artists from the artist lineup for the festival you are attending, and Playfest will select a few of each artist's top songs for the playlist. Once generated, the playlist is accessible via your Spotify apps.
